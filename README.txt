It is an android based smartphone app coded in 9 hrs as we got to know about this competition very late and we really wanted to participate in this challenge. Basically ERW detector lets you detect landmines by swiping/waving off your smartphone in air around 0.5-1 feet over the ground to detect landmines the accuracy can be adjusted by the user but that option is in development currently will take a couple of hours more and we dont have that much time so we used a predefined value that detects metal obects vey well.

After detection the user can then press the add button which helps them to add the details of the site like site name, repoter's name and GPS data etc. which can then be viewed over the website bluemoon.3space.info/viewusers.php which includes data reported by other users all over the world.
